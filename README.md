FT how it works (Fault-Tolerance)
https://www.techtarget.com/searchitchannel/feature/VSphere-Fault-Tolerance-requirements-and-FT-logging#:~:text=Fault%20Tolerance%20(FT),-Fault%20Tolerance%20(FT&text=FT%20takes%20that%20to%20the,created%20on%20another%20functional%20host.

FT is applicable on VM level, 
FT takes that to the next level and guarantees that the VM stays operational during a host failure by keeping a secondary copy of it running on another host server; in case of a host failure, that VM then becomes the primary VM and a new secondary is created on another functional host.
The primary VM and secondary VM stay in sync with each other by using a technology called Record/Replay

set +x: To stop debugging
set -e: script exit immediately if any command fails to run
set -u: enforces strict variable usage, if the variable is not set value, the script will exit with an error

what would be the result of each command:
echo $0: Display the current shell-like (bash / sh / csh)
echo $?: Displays the exit status of the last executed command. (0-succeeded / error - non-zero)
echo $$: Displays the process ID (PID) of the current shell.
echo $#: Displays the number of positional parameters (arguments) passed to a script or function.

$@: Treats each positional parameter as a separate word when enclosed in double quotes. Preferred when dealing with arguments that contain spaces or special characters.
$*: Treats all positional parameters as a single word when enclosed in double quotes. The arguments are concatenated with the first character of IFS as the separator.

How do you get input from the user in shell scripts?
Read input: **read** -p "enter a number: " num

##########################################################################################################################################################
Docker Architecture
  1. Client: Build, Pull, Run
  2. Docker Host: 
           a.Docker daemon: It manages docker objects such as images, containers, networks, and volumes with the help of the API requests of Docker.
           b.container: Containers are created from docker images as they are ready applications.
           c.Images: An image contains instructions for creating a docker container. It is just a read-only template.
  3. Registry: All the docker images are stored in the docker registry (Public or private)

How to edit the docker image? (example: my-img)
 - first, we need to run a container (# docker run -dt my-img)
 -  login to the container (docker exec -it <container_ID> bash)
 -  make changes to what you need for new image like create some Dir or install some packages
 -  Then commit changes (docker commit <conatiner_ID> new-image-name)

DockerFile
  - FROM: base image
  - WORKDIR: To set the working dir
  - EXPOSE: to expose any ports
  - ENTRYPOINT: When you start the Docker container, a command or script called ENTRYPOINT is executed.(only 1 ENTRYPOINT in DockerFile)
  - ENV: to set environment variables 
  - COPY: copying the files/dir to the image 
  - ADD: Downloading any data from URLs 
  - CMD: The main purpose of the CMD command is to start the process inside the container and it can be overridden
             Dockerfile can only have one CMD, 
  - RUN: To run any command
which instruction the docker image will take if we use both ENTRYPOINT and CMD in DockerFile
   - It takes only the last instruction(ENTRYPOINT or CMD) which mentioned in DockerFile

Diff b/w CMD and ENTRYPOINT
https://www.bmc.com/blogs/docker-cmd-vs-entrypoint/#:~:text=They%20both%20specify%20programs%20that,as%20arguments%20of%20the%20command.
  only 1 CMD and ENTRYPOINT in DockerFile
  CMD can be over wirtten using var's but ENTRYPOINT not
  If the Dockerfile has multiple CMD instructions, only the last one will take effect.
  If the Dockerfile has multiple ENTRYPOINT instructions, only the last one will take effect.
  
DockerFile:
 FROM python:3.9
 WORKDIR /app
 RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
 COPY . /app
 ADD packages /app/pacakges
 EXPOSE 8080
 CMD ["python", "app.py"]

 docker build -f DockerFile -t app:1.0.0

# AWS

How many AWS accounts do you have in the project? 
  3 Accounts || Prod(Infra and Devops teams) >> Stage (Testing and QA team) >> Dev (Developers)
What if ELB goes down and solution?
 max ELB doesn't go down bcz it AWS managed service
 pre-warming with AWS support if your traffic is high to hit LB (They will provide good hardware) 
Can I mount single EBS volumes to multiple EC2? NO
Can I mount multiple EBS volumes to a single EC2? Yes
How many EBS volumes can we attach to a single EC2? 24
EFS: 
 Can EFS be accessed from multiple AZs?  Yes
 class : stand (frequently accessed data) / IA (Infrequent Access)
S3 storage types (classes) ? 
What happens to my data when EC2 is terminated?
If U check "Delete on termination" then data will be deleted
Why I'm not able to login EC2?

EC2 instance type used in project: 
  web/api --> t3.xlarge
  app(java)--> need more CPU --> m5a.4xlarge
  batch --> we use arm(graviton2-based) to save cost
  DB: use memory based r6 type
  Then spot,RI, we use autoscaling 

**EC2 Launch:**
Name/tag --> AMI(image) --> Instance type --> key pair --> N/W(VPC / subnet / public IP / SG) --> Storage --> Advance settings
Why my Ec2 not pinging?
VPC components: 
  **VPC** : 
  **subnets**:
     IP address range in VPC
     you can create multiple subnets within a VPC, they are associated with different availability zones.
**Security Groups**:
  SG acts as a virtual firewall for your instances. They control inbound and outbound traffic based on user-defined rules.
  **Route table**:
     It controls traffic b/w subnets within VPC and the internet.
     Each subnet must be associated with an RT that specifies the routing rules.
 ** Internet Gateway** :
      Virtual router that connects a VPC to the internet
  **NAT gateway**: (N/W Add Translation)
     It provides internet access for private instances without exposing their IP add to the public
 
 **Network ACL**:
    They are subnet-level firewalls that control inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet level.
**vpc peering** : 
      VPC Peering is a networking connection between two Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) that allows them to communicate with each other privately using private IP addresses
**transit gateway** : 
    Connect multiple VPCs and on-premises networks through a single central gateway.

inline policy: 
   Inline policies are directly attached to a specific user, group, or role.
Managed Policy: Can be attached to multiple entities

 VPC Endpoint in AWS allows you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services without going through the public internet
If your EC2 instance is in a private subnet (no Internet Gateway/NAT Gateway) and you want it to access S3, the best and secure way is to use a VPC Gateway Endpoint for S3.
private-link vs vpc-endpoint: 

ALB vs NLB 
  
      

Diff b/w NAT gateway vs NAT instance
https://medium.com/@smt.dubey/aws-nat-gateway-nat-instance-8e31972df1cf

Autoscaling types:  Manual/Dynamic/Scheduled Scaling
https://www.developer.com/web-services/aws-auto-scaling-types-best-practices/

AWS --> VPC --> subnet --> SG --> CIDR --> Route table , IAM
Patching, monitoring,
vpc peering: https://medium.com/@vishal.sharma./create-an-aws-vpc-peering-connection-47ce518de870 

Azure --> vNET --> subnets --> NSG / ASG --> CIDR
For example, you might have a VNet that contains multiple subnets, each hosting different types of resources. You can use NSGs to control the traffic between these subnets and from the internet. ASGs can be used to group VMs with similar roles, making it easier to manage and update security rules.

1.Route53 type: https://gauravguptacloud.medium.com/aws-route53-records-routing-policies-f3657b01ffa2
public hosted zone -- traffic is routed on the internet
private hosted zone -- traffic is routed within an aws vpc
Latency-based routing in AWS Route53
How AWS N/W firewall protect VPC?
Stateful vs State-less firewall in AWS?
When do we use spot or on-demand EC2?
what is ECS? cluster? EC2 vs Fragent?

**Lambda**
1.Lambda function that runs every 24 hours, checks for untagged AWS resources, and sends an email to your team distribution list via Amazon SES.

2.Created Lambda functions(python) to create a ebs volume snapshot with event bridge / same for delete the ebs snapshot after 7 days 

3.created lambda function to detects the manual changes in aws resources(created by terraform)-- who changed/which resource/time stamp

    1.CloudTrail â€“ enabled to log all API activity across the AWS account.
    2.CloudWatch EventBridge Rule â€“ monitors for specific Write API calls (like ModifyInstanceAttribute, PutBucketPolicy, CreateUser, etc.) by IAM users.
    3.Lambda Function â€“ triggered by EventBridge when such changes occur.

How can you instruct your pipeline to schedule a job on a specific node that has JDK 7.0, when it is only available on one node out of ten? 
What are Executors in Jenkins?
  An Executor is just a slot in which to run a job on an agent/node. An agent can have zero or more executors. The number of executors per Agent defines how many concurrent jobs can be run to that agent.
what is a multi-branch pipeline
How do you secure the Jenkins server?

Git branch Strategies?  
Main
Develop
Feature
Release
Hotfix

How do discard changes in working dir?
#git checkout -- <file_name>
#git checkout -- . 

we have 50 commits in DEVELOP branch out of which only 5 commits need to be pushed in RELEASE branch.
--> Use git cherry-pick
#git cherry-pick <commitsha>

Developer has developed an app module in local with 100 commits, but now he wants to push all his changes in remote DEVELOP branch as a single commit?
# git rebase -i HEAD~3 (last 3 commits)
what is git stash? 
  when you want to switch b/w branches but not to commit the code, then we can use git stash to temp save the code
  Git stash command takes your uncommitted changes and saves them away for later use
#git stash
#git stash list
#git stash pop <stash_name/ID>

Do you have experience in configuration management tools like Ansible?   
Ansible playbook error checks 
  ansible-playbook your_playbook.yml --check: Dry run of playbook, what will happen when play executed
  ansible-playbook your_playbook.yml --syntax-check:  To check the syntax of playbook 
  ansible-playbook your_playbook.yml --list-hosts: To check the on which hosts playbook will run 
  ansible-playbook your_playbook.yml --list-tasks: To check what are tasks playbook will run

2. When including a role in a playbook, you can pass variables to the role using the vars parameter.
3. Variables defined directly in the playbook, vars sections
4. Variables defined in the role defaults/main.yml file
